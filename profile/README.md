## Personalized Wallet for Every User
One of the best services we offer to Iranian users is the personalized wallet feature. This means you can create a personalized sub-account with your desired name after setting up your user account on My Wallet. You can manage different balances in each wallet. For example, a father can create his own account and decide to create three different sub-accounts for his children, each with its own dedicated address and specific balance. This feature allows you to convert currency from one account without affecting the balance of others, providing a truly personalized experience.

‚ö†Ô∏è Ready to look at the progress of digital currencies? Let‚Äôs take a moment to reflect on how the world is changing. Back in 2011, many experts claimed no one would use Bitcoin, declaring the system fundamentally flawed. Within a year, they said only computer specialists would use it due to its complexities. Between 2014 and 2016, as the world of digital currencies grew, some critics argued that cryptocurrencies were mainly used by criminals, money launderers, and gamblers. In 2018, they said only a small percentage of the population used Bitcoin and Ethereum. üòÅ Then in 2020, as digital currencies like Dogecoin were embraced by companies like Tesla, it became clear that it wasn‚Äôt just small businesses using cryptocurrencies anymore. Finally, in 2021, critics, with tears in their eyes, declared that only small countries, like El Salvador in Central America, were adopting digital currencies. Is this still not enough proof? Do you still need more time to believe that investing in cryptocurrencies is one of the best opportunities available today?

One of Bitcoin's earliest critics, Warren Buffett, surrendered in 2021 by purchasing a company that developed cryptocurrency infrastructure. Fast forward to 2029, and we‚Äôll tell the rest of the story: they'll say that, unfortunately, no one on Earth is satisfied with the outdated and slow banking system anymore, and the banking system has failed. People are free to interact globally without limitations, using digital currencies.

‚ö†Ô∏è If you have the opportunity to buy cryptocurrencies today, don‚Äôt miss it. There are 8 billion people on Earth, but only 21 million Bitcoins will ever exist. That means only 0.0026 Bitcoins per person. Yes, 381 people will fight over each Bitcoin. Interestingly, many crypto passwords get forgotten, and those Bitcoins will remain untouched forever, meaning even fewer than 21 million Bitcoins will be in circulation.

Make sure to have Bitcoin in your portfolio.
